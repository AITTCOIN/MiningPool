		<div class="card-header tx-medium bd-0 tx-white bg-primary-dark"><span>What is difficulty?</span></div>
		<div class="card-body">Difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a hash below a given target.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10 mg-t-20">
		<div class="card-header tx-medium bd-0 tx-white bg-primary-dark"><span>What is luck?</span></div>
		<div class="card-body">Mining is probabilistic in nature: if you find a block earlier than you statistically should on average you are lucky if it takes longer, you are unlucky. In a perfect World pool would find a block on 100% luck value. Less then 100% means the pool was lucky. More then 100% means the pool was unlucky.</div>

		<div class="card-header tx-medium bd-0 tx-white bg-primary-dark"><span>What is share?</span></div>
		<div class="card-body">Share is a possible valid hash for the block. Shares are beings sent by your rigs to the pool to prove their work.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10 mg-t-20">
		<div class="card-header tx-medium bd-0 tx-white bg-primary-dark"><span>What is block?</span></div>
		<div class="card-body">Transaction data is recorded in blocks. New transactions are being processes by miners into new blocks which are added to the end of the blockchain.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10 mg-t-20">
		<div class="card-header tx-medium bd-0 tx-white bg-primary-dark"><span>How long does it take to find a block?</span></div>
		<div class="card-body">It depends on amount of active miners. The more miners work on pool &rarr; the more hashrate pool has &rarr; the more blocks are found by the pool. However the more miners are active &rarr; the less reward you get from each block found.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10 mg-t-20">
		<div class="card-header tx-medium bd-0 tx-white bg-primary-dark"><span>Which payouts scheme is used?</span></div>
		<div class="card-body">Proportional (Share-based): Every time a block is found, its reward is split between miners according to the number of shares they submitted.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10 mg-t-20">
		<div class="card-header tx-medium bd-0 tx-white bg-primary-dark"><span>How current payout estimate is calculated?</span></div>
		<div class="card-body">The estimated payout is a calculated using your percentage of valid shares on the total for current round. This percentage is then applied to the reward of the last block found by the network.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10 mg-t-20">
		<div class="card-header tx-medium bd-0 tx-white bg-primary-dark"><span>I have been mining on this pool for 1 hour but still have not received any payouts. WTF?</span></div>
		<div class="card-body">As soon as the block is found you will get your reward. Please wait a little bit more time.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="card padding-15 push-down-10 mg-t-20">
		<div class="card-header tx-medium bd-0 tx-white bg-primary-dark"><span>My hashrate is wrong! Why?</span></div>
		<div class="card-body">Since you start to mine your hashrate grows gradually. Please wait. The pool determines your hashrate based on the amount of shares sent by your mining rigs (workers). This value could be a little bit different from reported hasrate (in your mining software).</div>
